            <h2>Interest In Information Technology<h2>
            <p>
                As a child I played a lot of NES, and later Gameboy and PlayStation. We didn’t have a home computer until I was in high school. Until this point, most of my experience with computers happened at school or at the library. At one point my uncle acquired a very old computer. Its OS was an early version of Windows, and the screen glew a stunningly monochromatic orange. I used our home computer to chat with school friends on MSN and used it to decorate my MySpace profile. This was my first exposure to HTML. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I took an elective subject as part of my degree which focused on web development. After this I left my degree to study a Certificate IV in Information Technology at TAFE. I went on to study Computer Science at Latrobe which was mostly great. I loved the Discrete mathematics and the Algebra, but I hated the Trigonometry. I found it difficult to connect with my peers as they were all straight out of high school. I took a unit at Open Uni to try out the online study, and I found it much easier organise my life around. Despite the limited courses available, I enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT to make use of the online learning format.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think my biggest motivation for wanting to study in this area was to learn more about how computers worked, and how to make them do things. I was inspired by video games and also by (the relatively new at the time) smart phone apps. I remember that I would often think “I wish I had an app to do X”, or “I wish this app did Y like this”. During this degree, I would hope to learn how to make useful things with various information technologies, such as apps for smartphones or Raspberry Pi projects, although my expectations are low.
            </p>

        <div class="chunk" id="C3">
            <h2>Ideal Job<h2>
            <p>
                Ideally I would want to be working in a non-profit-driven  organisation in an IT adjacent role, such as a library technician or an administration officer. The assignment may well be asking for my ideal IT job, perhaps even assuming that I am enrolled in this course with the aim of moving into the IT industry. I have therefore chosen a help desk job advertisement pictured and linked below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a class="main_link" href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51168550?type=standout#searchRequestToken=f489f59e-ac39-4e63-ad6c-1b330d6b30fe" >Link to Job Advertisement.</a>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="job_ad.png" class="main_images" alt="A Job advertisement titled Help desk 1/2 support.">
                <figcaption><b>Figure 1.</b> <i>Help Desk Level 1/2 Support</i> by EllisKing, 2020 </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
            The position described in the advertisement is that of an IT support person who would complete basic and necessary tasks: configuring, testing and troubleshooting hardware and software; supporting staff with IT queries and training; keeping track of IT assets. This role appeals to me as I would be able to communicate directly with clients and support them in learning how to interact with their technology. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The advertisement is asking for non-specialist experience supporting users within a Microsoft environment. The advertisement also requests experience installing Windows on devices. The skills requested are common to most job advertisements: problem solving, communication, customer driven, punctual, planned. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In my current job I do walk clients through various software, and I attempt to provide an environment where they feel supported to learn rather than showing them directly. From talking with help desk team members at my current place of work, I know that at least here, qualifications are not needed for level 1 support roles which would involve referring to a database of known issues. In my current team, I have been able to identify most of the problems with Windows that my team members have come across, often needing the administrators to carry out the solutions as my account wouldn’t have the privileges. I have installed older versions of Windows on many PCs, and fewer times I have installed Windows 10 on PCs. I have tinkered a lot within Windows and Linux so I am familiar with the intricacies of navigating OS tools that may be used, and so I shouldn’t have any problem providing Level 1 support. Between myself and Google, I would probably do ok at providing level 2 support. I have all the requested skills, and in fact I use them all in my current job. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I think I could be successful were I to apply for this position, though I may not be the best candidate for the job. Seeking out a level 1 help desk position would give me on the job experience and would lead to me developing a deeper familiarity with the admin side of windows and some of the more common issues that come up. The thing I would most have to work on though, would be my interviewing. 
            </p>

        <div class="chunk" id="C4">
            <h2>Personal Profile<h2>
            <p>
                While I have provided a set of Myers-Briggs results for this assignment, such personality tests are pseudoscience and I disagree with their inclusion in an academic assessment. Were I to be asked to take such a test in an interview, I would treat it as a red-flag and I would consider exiting the interview. That these tests are used widely in the IT industry is a problem, and treating them as something to be familiar with only exacerbates this issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                To me these test results are at best incorrect, and at worse a scam. Out of the three test results, the one that matches how I see my own personality, (and how other people have told me that they see me) is the Horoscope. Does this mean that I should trust my horoscope? Should I bring these results to job interviews to show my potential employer? It probably wouldn’t work out too well for me (although you never know what people believe). If I took my horoscope results and presented them in the Meyer-Briggs format, would this be more acceptable?
            </p>
            <p>
                These results won’t influence my behaviour on a team, because they are pseudoscience. What would influence my behaviour on a team is what my team members are like. They can tell me that a test said their personality was like this or that, but the only way I will know what their personality is like, is by working with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                These results have no place in deciding how a team should be formed. The only role that tests like these have is to enable us to think about what our personality traits actually are. It can be fun to take a test and come up with a reflection of yourself, (that is why people use horoscopes,) but it should only be used as a tool for your own self-reflection, and not as some sort of puzzle piece to match yourself with other team members.

            <h2>Project Idea<h2>
                <h3 id="J1" >Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    I want to create a database and recommendation tool for anime. The tool would provide overviews of anime properties and suggest related and similar anime series. The format of the tool would begin as a browser extension for an existing anime review website and could grow into a separate website or mobile app that could be used to track watched anime. While existing anime review website (such as myanimelist.net) provide information on individual seasons of anime series, they focus on reviewing individual episodes and seasons and do not link seasons of the same anime together in a convenient manner. The main focus of this tool would be to link related seasons and series together so that users can discover new anime easily. 
                </p>
                <h3 id="J2" >Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    While I was searching for a website where I could track my watched anime, I became frustrated that all of the websites that I tried did not link together seasons of a single anime. For example, Season 1 and season 2 of My Hero Academia would be treated as different anime series in their databases, where as a service like Netflix would provide a single series page with links to the different seasons. While the current users may not require this service, it’s prospective users such as myself who’s anime knowledge is not so deep, and who’s needs have not been met by these websites who will benefit.
                </p>
                <h3 id="J3" >Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The base of both the extension and the later website or app would be the database. Our database would at first be populated with information from MyAnimeList’s (MAL) database. Later, features would be added to allow users to add information to our database, such a tags. User accounts would be created to allow users to relate any submitted information to their own account.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users would add the extension via the Chrome web store.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important feature to implement would be the ability for users to view related anime seasons and series. On each MAL season page, a list of hyperlinks will be injected into the page to link to other seasons of the anime and related content (such as movies or spinoffs) from the same property. Release dates would be included to give a context to the series, and the list would be split between main series entries and then movies and spinoffs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A similar feature we would want to implement would be to recommend anime related to the currently viewed series. This feature is available on MAL, based on user suggestion, but we would aim to identify similar series using user generated tags. Users would click a button on the series web page, and a window with a text box would pop up. Users would write their tags in the text box, and click ok, and the tags would be added to our database. A certain number of tags would need to be added before a match could be made. A list of links to the anime series with the most similar tags would be populated and injected into the page. A percentage would be show next to each link describing the match. This feature will need a larger user base, or else a significant time investment to become successful.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tags would not be shown to users, as care should be taken to avoid spoiling any series. Submitted user tags would be stored in our database and we would maintain a blacklist of words that are inappropriate as tags. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A third feature of the browser extension would be a search bar made available by clicking the extension icon. This would perform a regex search of anime names, descriptions and tags stored in our database and would return links to relevant MAL series pages.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once these features have been implemented, creating a mobile friendly app or website would be the next goal to move towards. This standalone product would be based on the same database as the extension. This app would provide series overviews, drawing together related information so that users can grasp the scale of the series they view and would allow users to create lists of anime series and seasons. These overview pages would at first link to MAL series pages but would aim to become more of a wiki as our database is populated with information from users. Users' lists and tags would be saved into our database against their user account, if they chose to create one.  
                </p>
                <h3 id="J4" >Tools and Technologies</h3>
                <p>
                    A database such as MySQL would be required for storing IDs for each anime season and the relationships between them. A hosting service such as Amazon would be used to host and connect to the database, and to host the website were that feature to eventuate. JavaScript would be required to inject information into the pages. The chrome web store would be used to host and distribute the extension. GitHub would be used to host and backup the code. In order to get the information, the MyAnimeList API can be used, or Jikan can be used. (A popular open source API for MyAnimeList with many wrappers.)

                    Learning how to use Amazon web services is probably the most different skill to acquire. JavaScript and MySQL are essential, but not difficult. Scripts for scraping the MAL database and updating our own must be written. The extension must be written and needs to be able to query our database. The MAL database does contain sequel information so many of the relationships could be worked out with a script, however curation may be required. Eventually an option for users to update our database can be added to the extension.

                <h3 id="J6" >Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                    If the project is successful, potential users like myself will find MAL to be a more useful website. The original problem will be solved as users will have a way to discover related anime, and to gain a sense of the size and complexity of certain anime properties. This will likely lead to a greater literacy in the anime Zeitgeist. This may lead to an increase in MAL’s traffic. As we expanded a full website or mobile app we would potentially reach a much larger audience.
